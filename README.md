# Diabetes vs. Sugar Intake Analysis 📊🍬

This project uses **Python** and **Matplotlib** to visualize and explore the relationship between **average sugar consumption** and **diabetes prevalence** across different countries.

The goal is to provide a clear, visual way to understand whether higher sugar intake is associated with increased diabetes rates.

---

## 📌 Overview
Using publicly available health and nutrition data, this project:
- Loads sugar consumption and diabetes prevalence data
- Creates **scatter plots** to compare variables
- Adds **trendlines** to show correlation patterns
- Uses Matplotlib styling for clear, professional visuals

This type of visualization can be useful for:
- Public health research
- Data journalism
- Nutrition advocacy
- Academic projects

---

## ✨ Features
- **Scatter plot** of sugar intake vs. diabetes rates
- **Linear regression trendline** to visualize correlation
- **Custom axis labels & titles**
- **Color-coded points** for better readability
- **Exportable graphs** for reports and presentations

---

## 🛠 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kcamacho1/matPlotLibFun.git
   cd matPlotLibFun
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```
3. Install dependencies:
```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the main script:
```
bash
python main.py
```
This will:
- Load the dataset
- Generate a scatter plot comparing sugar consumption (g/day) to diabetes prevalence (% of population)
- Display the trendline to illustrate correlation
